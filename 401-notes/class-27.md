# Django Models
## Model definition
Models are usually defined in an application's models.py file. They are implemented as subclasses of django.db.models.Model, and can include fields, methods and metadata. The code fragment below shows a "typical" model, named MyModelName:

from django.db import models

class MyModelName(models.Model):
    """A typical class defining a model, derived from the Model class."""

    # Fields
    my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')
    ...

    # Metadata
    class Meta: 
        ordering = ['-my_field_name']

    # Methods
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        """Returns the url to access a particular instance of MyModelName."""
        return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])
    
    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the MyModelName object (in Admin site etc.)."""
        return self.my_field_name

## Common field types
The following list describes some of the more commonly used types of fields. 

CharField is used to define short-to-mid sized fixed-length strings. You must specify the max_length of the data to be stored.
TextField is used for large arbitrary-length strings. You may specify a max_length for the field, but this is used only when the field is displayed in forms (it is not enforced at the database level).
IntegerField is a field for storing integer (whole number) values, and for validating entered values as integers in forms.
DateField and DateTimeField are used for storing/representing dates and date/time information (as Python datetime.date in and datetime.datetime objects, respectively). These fields can additionally declare the (mutually exclusive) parameters auto_now=True (to set the field to the current date every time the model is saved), auto_now_add (to only set the date when the model is first created) , and default (to set a default date that can be overridden by the user).
EmailField is used to store and validate email addresses.
FileField and ImageField are used to upload files and images respectively (the ImageField simply adds additional validation that the uploaded file is an image). These have parameters to define how and where the uploaded files are stored.
AutoField is a special type of IntegerField that automatically increments. A primary key of this type is automatically added to your model if you donâ€™t explicitly specify one.
ForeignKey is used to specify a one-to-many relationship to another database model (e.g. a car has one manufacturer, but a manufacturer can make many cars). The "one" side of the relationship is the model that contains the "key" (models containing a "foreign key" referring to that "key", are on the "many" side of such a relationship).
ManyToManyField is used to specify a many-to-many relationship (e.g. a book can have several genres, and each genre can contain several books). In our library app we will use these very similarly to ForeignKeys, but they can be used in more complicated ways to describe the relationships between groups. These have the parameter on_delete to define what happens when the associated record is deleted (e.g. a value of models.SET_NULL would simply set the value to NULL).

## Metadata
You can declare model-level metadata for your Model by declaring class Meta, as shown.

class Meta:
    ordering = ['-my_field_name']

ordering = ['title', '-pubdate']

the books would be sorted alphabetically by title, from A-Z, and then by publication date inside each title, from newest to oldest.

## Methods
A model can also have methods.

Minimally, in every model you should define the standard Python class method __str__() to return a human-readable string for each object. This string is used to represent individual records in the administration site (and anywhere else you need to refer to a model instance). Often this will return a title or name field from the model.

def __str__(self):
    return self.field_name

Another common method to include in Django models is get_absolute_url(), which returns a URL for displaying individual model records on the website (if you define this method then Django will automatically add a "View on Site" button to the model's record editing screens in the Admin site). A typical pattern for get_absolute_url() is shown below.

def get_absolute_url(self):
    """Returns the url to access a particular instance of the model."""
    return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])

## Creating and modifying records
To create a record you can define an instance of the model and then call save().

#Create a new record using the model's constructor.
record = MyModelName(my_field_name="Instance #1")

#Save the object into the database.
record.save()

#Access model field values using Python attributes.
print(record.id) # should return 1 for the first record. 
print(record.my_field_name) # should print 'Instance #1'

#Change record by modifying the fields, then calling save().
record.my_field_name = "New Instance Name"
record.save()

## Searching for records
We can get all records for a model as a QuerySet, using objects.all(). The QuerySet is an iterable object, meaning that it contains a number of objects that we can iterate/loop through.

all_books = Book.objects.all()

Django's filter() method allows us to filter the returned QuerySet to match a specified text or numeric field against particular criteria. For example, to filter for books that contain "wild" in the title and then count them, we could do the following.

wild_books = Book.objects.filter(title__contains='wild')
number_wild_books = wild_books.count()

## Genre model
class Genre(models.Model):
    """Model representing a book genre."""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200, help_text='Enter a book genre (e.g. Science Fiction)')
    
    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the Model object."""
        return self.name

## BookInstance model
import uuid # Required for unique book instances

class BookInstance(models.Model):
    """Model representing a specific copy of a book (i.e. that can be borrowed from the library).""" \
    id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, help_text='Unique ID for this particular book across whole library') \
    book = models.ForeignKey('Book', on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True) \
    imprint = models.CharField(max_length=200) \
    due_back = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)

    LOAN_STATUS = (
        ('m', 'Maintenance'),
        ('o', 'On loan'),
        ('a', 'Available'),
        ('r', 'Reserved'),
    )

    status = models.CharField(
        max_length=1,
        choices=LOAN_STATUS,
        blank=True,
        default='m',
        help_text='Book availability',
    )

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['due_back']

    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the Model object."""
        return f'{self.id} ({self.book.title})'

## Author model
Copy the Author model (shown below) underneath the existing code in models.py.

class Author(models.Model):
    """Model representing an author."""
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    date_of_birth = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    date_of_death = models.DateField('Died', null=True, blank=True)

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['last_name', 'first_name']

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        """Returns the url to access a particular author instance."""
        return reverse('author-detail', args=[str(self.id)])

    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the Model object."""
        return f'{self.last_name}, {self.first_name}'
    
## Re-run the database migrations
All your models have now been created. Now re-run your database migrations to add them to your database.

python3 manage.py makemigrations \
python3 manage.py migrate

# Django admin site
## Registering models 

from .models import Author, Genre, Book, BookInstance

admin.site.register(Book) \
admin.site.register(Author) \
admin.site.register(Genre) \
admin.site.register(BookInstance)

## Creating a superuser
python3 manage.py createsuperuser \
python3 manage.py runserver

## Register a ModelAdmin class
To change how a model is displayed in the admin interface you define a ModelAdmin class (which describes the layout) and register it with the model.

Let's start with the Author model. Open admin.py in the catalog application (/locallibrary/catalog/admin.py). Comment out your original registration (prefix it with a #) for the Author model:

#admin.site.register(Author)
Now add a new AuthorAdmin and registration as shown below.

#Define the admin class
class AuthorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass

#Register the admin class with the associated model
admin.site.register(Author, AuthorAdmin)
Now we'll add ModelAdmin classes for Book, and BookInstance. We again need to comment out the original registrations:

#admin.site.register(Book)
#admin.site.register(BookInstance)
Now to create and register the new models; for the purpose of this demonstration, we'll instead use the @register decorator to register the models (this does exactly the same thing as the admin.site.register() syntax):

#Register the Admin classes for Book using the decorator
@admin.register(Book)
class BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass

#Register the Admin classes for BookInstance using the decorator
@admin.register(BookInstance) 
class BookInstanceAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass

## Configure list views
class AuthorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin): \
    list_display = ('last_name', 'first_name', 'date_of_birth', 'date_of_death')
